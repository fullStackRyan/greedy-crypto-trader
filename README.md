# About

[Alternative API](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/) provides sentiment analysis on the current state of the Bitcoin market by analysing:
- Volatility (25%)
- Market Momentum/Volume (25%)
- Social Media (15%)
- Surveys (15%) currently paused
- Dominance (10%)
- Trends (10%)

This app aims to invest fake money based of the various states of the fear and greed index. It will buy when the market is in a state of Extreme Fear and sell when it is in a state of Extreme Greed.

It will call to the Binance API to get an accurate price of Bitcoin during the various states. 

How long will it take to go broke or become a Bitcoin Billionare?
